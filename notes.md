- Installed c2rust. No luck because c2rust is trying to map all types
- corrode didn't work either =(

- time to translate by hand!

- got the hello world compiling with clang 11.

- got basic loading / unloading working and recognising device
- had to tweak around in linux-kernel-module bindings to add a whole load more headers
